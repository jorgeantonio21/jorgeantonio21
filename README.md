## 🧑‍💻 About

I build high-performance distributed systems at the intersection of AI inference, cryptography, and fault-tolerant computing. I previously co-founded [Atoma](https://atoma.ai), building infrastructure for secure GenAI workloads with confidential computing — fast serverless LLM inference with verifiable privacy guarantees.

### 🎓 Research & Academic Background

My background is rooted in pure mathematics — I hold a PhD in algebraic geometry and algebraic topology from the University of Toulouse, where I worked under [Bertrand Toen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bertrand_To%C3%ABn) on derived arithmetic geometry. My research focused on derived non-archimedean analytic geometry, including derived formal schemes, Raynaud localization, and non-archimedean Hodge filtrations. Selected publications on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/search/?query=Jorge+Ant%C3%B3nio&searchtype=author).

## 🔭 What I Work On

- 🚀 **Large-scale LLM inference** — High-throughput serving systems, GPU kernel optimization, distributed inference orchestration
- 🌐 **Distributed systems** — Consensus protocols (including [Minimmit](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10862) implementation), fault tolerance, state machine replication
- 🔐 **Cryptography** — Zero-knowledge proof systems (PLONK, Plonky2/3, STARKs), applied cryptographic protocols, verifiable computation
- 🛡️ **Confidential computing** — TEE-based inference, hardware-rooted trust, secure multi-party AI workloads
- ⚡ **High-frequency low-latency trading systems** — Performance-critical infrastructure, lock-free data structures, kernel-bypass networking
