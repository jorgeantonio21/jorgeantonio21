# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Repository Purpose

This is a GitHub profile repository (`jorgeantonio21/jorgeantonio21`). The README.md appears on the owner's GitHub profile page. There is no application code, build system, or tests — just a single README.md file.

## Editing

Changes to `README.md` are the only edits expected. The file contains a personal introduction with professional interests and skills. Keep the existing tone and formatting style (plain markdown lists, Feynman quotes at the top).
